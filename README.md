# Newt - New Tab Seeder
A new way to think about URL bookmarks. It will be a highly interactive way of presenting a collated set of URLs based on the task at hand. Using a vault grid, you can search, sort, filter, re-arrange, re-combine, and more &mdash; letting you narrow down the results for optimum focus while surfing/researching.

Inspiration provided by Svalbard Global Seed Vault.

## Definitions

*seed*
: The building block URL. It does not have to be truncated to the domain name + TLD. For example, the seed could be the URL to the login page.

*strain / variant*
: Another URL based on the same domain as the seed. Useful for creating quick links to frequently visited endpoints of the same domain as the seed.

*seed vault*
: A collection of seeds.
