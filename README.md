# Newt - New Tab Seeder
A new way to think about URL bookmarks. It will be a highly interactive way of presenting a collated set of URLs based on the task at hand. Using a vault grid, you can search, sort, filter, re-arrange, re-combine, and more &mdash; letting you narrow down the results for optimum focus while surfing/researching.

Inspiration provided by Svalbard Global Seed Vault.

## Features

- Spacebar pans around screen.
- Search and filter as you type.
- Google/Duckduckgo search only certain sites.
- Nested sub-containers.
- Recent URLs automatically go to top of seed vault.
- Tags for URLs.
- Spontaneous reminders of historical tabs.
- Rate/score URL seeds/plants/seed vault.
- Remembers scroll position on page and even points you to the exact sentence you should read next.
- Shareable pods/packages.
